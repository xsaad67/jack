SELECT statement that will produce an order report based on a date range and member nursery (you will need to have the data in the database for this query):

o List of all orders between a start date and an end date for a particular nursery,
o the report will be grouped by client,
o each line in the list will include Client name, client state, order number /id and total for that order,
o will be ordered by oldest order at the top

SELECT statement/s that will produce the following data for a sample order
(you will need to have the data in the database for this query):
o The Client ORDER will include:
 client name and account number,
 order number / id and the total amount for the order,
 order date,
 At least three order items:
• item name,
• quantity,
• price,
• shipping cost,
• item total cost incorporating the native plant cost
calculation Function / Procedure (HINT a function is
much easier to call in a SELECT statement)

Clients can purchase native plants from any ANP member. However shipping costs for shipping plants within that ANP member’s state is much cheaper than sending them interstate. Anna has a shipping cost agreement among ANP coop members as follows:

• If a client purchases plants from ANP members located within the client’s state or territory,
the total price for the plant delivered to the client will be the listed price plus the unit shipping
cost.

• for all interstate purchases the client will multiply the corresponding shipping multiplier
(table below) by the unit shipping cost.

For example:
• Abigail from Parks in New South Wales (NSW) has ordered a quantity of 2 ‘graceful wattle’ from an ANP member nursery in Armadale NSW. The nursery listed price for each ‘graceful
wattle’ is $65 plus $120 shipping cost. The total cost to Harry would be (2 * $65) + (1 * (2 *
$120)) = $370 total cost. Shipping Multiplier = 1.
• Johnathan from Perth in Western Australia (WA) has ordered a quantity of 2 ‘graceful wattle’
from the same ANP member nursery in Armadale NSW. The shipping multiplier from NSW
to WA is 2.4 so the total cost to Margaret would be (2 * $65) + (2.4 * (2 * $120)) = $706 total
cost. Shipping Multiplier = 2.4.

The general calculation is as follows:
Plant cost = plant quantity * plant price
Shipping cost = shipping multiplier * plant quantity * plant unit shipping cost
Total order cost = shipping cost + plant cost
