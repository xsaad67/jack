Clients can purchase native plants from any ANP member. However shipping costs for shipping plants within that ANP member’s state is much cheaper than sending them interstate. Anna has a shipping cost agreement among ANP coop members as follows:•If a client purchases plants from ANP members located within the client’s state or territory, the total price for the plant delivered to the client will be the listed price plus the unit shipping cost. •for all interstate purchases the client will multiply the corresponding shipping multiplier (table below) by the unit shipping cost.For example:•Abigail from Parks in New South Wales (NSW) has ordered a quantity of 2 ‘graceful wattle’from an ANP member nursery in Armadale NSW. The nursery listed price for each ‘graceful wattle’ is $65 plus $120 shipping cost. The total cost to Harry would be (2 * $65) + (1 * (2 * $120))  = $370 total cost. Shipping Multiplier = 1.•Johnathan from Perth in Western Australia (WA) has ordered a quantity of 2 ‘graceful wattle’ from the same ANP member nursery in Armadale NSW. The shipping multiplier from NSW to WA is 2.4 so the total cost to Margaret would be (2 * $65) + (2.4 * (2 * $120)) = $706 total cost. Shipping Multiplier = 2.4.The general calculation is as follows:Plant cost = plant quantity * plant priceShipping cost = shipping multiplier * plant quantity * plant unit shipping costTotal order cost = shipping cost + plant cost
